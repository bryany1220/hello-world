# hello-world
first github repository
Hi! Thanks for visiting my GitHub page. My name is Bryan and I'm currently a third year at UCR studying data science. I went into this field hoping to exercise my skills in statistical analysis, as well as demonstrating my affinity with numbers. I'm hoping to work either in the semiconductor industry or in a government role. In my spare time I do fencing, draw, animate, and work out at the gym. Within all of these fields, I am an eager learner and hope to expand my skills not just within the field of data science, but within all aspects of my life. 

And since you're already on my GitHub page, feel free to add me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-yu-977a5421a/

I look forward to potentially working with you in the future! Feel free to browse my other projects in the meantime (assuming I have something on here...soon...:)
